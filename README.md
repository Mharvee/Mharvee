#  Hi, I'm Marvellous Onohwakpor

I'm a university student and tech enthusiast passionate about combining **Cybersecurity** and **Computer Vision** to solve real-world problems.

On one side, I‚Äôm diving into **threat detection, incident response, and digital forensics** to understand how to protect systems from attack.

On the other, I‚Äôm exploring how machines can interpret visual data through **Computer Vision**, using Python and AI to help machines "see" and make decisions.

I believe the intersection of these two fields will shape the future of secure, intelligent systems and I want to be part of that.
