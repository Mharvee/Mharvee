Hi, I'm Marvellous Onohwakpor

 I'm a university student and tech enthusiast diving deep into the world of Python, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Vision.

 I'm currently exploring how machines see and understand the world — and it's been an exciting journey so far.

 Always learning, building, and sharing what I discover along the way.
